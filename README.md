# [block_size](https://github.com/rogerjbos/block_size)
Minimal examples calculating block_size for Polkadot block in rust (using subxt) and JS.  Since these are mimimal examples, I put them in this one repository.


```
node block_size.js
```
Polkadot block 26_879_030 SCALE-encoded size (toU8a): 79_257 bytes

```
cargo run
```
Polkadot block 26_879_030 SCALE-encoded size: 79_263 bytes
